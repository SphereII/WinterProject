***
*** Warning! Due to the snow effect, approaching towns or large POIs will lag you out a bit. Slow down and it'll catch up!
***
				
 Based on the ComSens Mod from CraterCreator, with RainUI from Dust2Death, the Winter Project shoves you into a world covered in snow for a unique play style never experienced yet. 
 
See the world from a completely different point of view, and face new and old challenges as you explore and experience a world frozen during the last Christmas Holiday...

Merry "ComSens", welcome to the Winter Project!
